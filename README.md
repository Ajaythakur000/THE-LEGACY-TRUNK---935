## üìñ About The Project

[cite_start]For the Great Zanetti family, the circus is a hundred-year-old bond forged in sawdust and starlight. [cite: 9] [cite_start]Their heritage is a tapestry of legendary acts and whispered family stories passed from grandparent to grandchild. [cite: 10] [cite_start]But as the elder Zanettis take their final bow, this precious heritage is fading. [cite: 11]

[cite_start]**The Legacy Trunk** is a private digital hearth where every family member can safeguard their stories, media, and heirlooms, ensuring their kinship and magic live on forever. [cite: 13] It's a secure space to build a collective family memory, accessible anytime, anywhere.
