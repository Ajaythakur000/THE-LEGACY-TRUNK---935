# üî± The Legacy Trunk

*Preserving family stories and memories across generations.*

---

## üìñ About The Project

For the Great Zanetti family, the circus is a hundred-year-old bond forged in sawdust and starlight. Their heritage is a tapestry of legendary acts and whispered family stories passed from grandparent to grandchild. But as the elder Zanettis take their final bow, this precious heritage is fading.

**The Legacy Trunk** is a private digital hearth where every family member can safeguard their stories, media, and heirlooms, ensuring their kinship and magic live on forever. It's a secure space to build a collective family memory, accessible anytime, anywhere.
